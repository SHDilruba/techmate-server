  "question": "What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?",
    "answer": "The state of any application is represented by the user interface of the application. The state is mutable and whenever the user interacts with the application and changes its state, the user interface of the app may change as it will be represented by the new state. These states can be managed by a React component. The main objectives of the react component are to store the state and allow it to get updated once the user interacts with the application."

    "question": "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
    "answer": "Simply put, prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function."

    "question": "What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?",
    "answer": "Unit Testing is the process of writing and automatically running tests to ensure that the functions you code work as expected. A “Unit” is the smallest possible software component in the app (i.e, functions, classes, or components). While unit tests are important, they also aren’t the only testing you should be doing. Running End-to-End UI testing and manual human review will catch plenty of logic bugs that unit tests may miss when every unit is operating as expected."

    "question": "React vs. Angular vs. Vue?",
    "answer": "React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework.They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they’re not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences. Each framework is component-based and allows the rapid creation of UI features."
